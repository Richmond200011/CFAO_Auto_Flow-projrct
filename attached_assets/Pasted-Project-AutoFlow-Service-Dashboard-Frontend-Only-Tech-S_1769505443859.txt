Project: AutoFlow Service Dashboard (Frontend Only)

Tech Stack: React.js + Tailwind CSS
Requirements:

Responsive Design:

Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

Uses Tailwind responsive utilities (sm, md, lg, xl)

Layout matches the screenshots provided (dashboard & auth screens)

Components to Implement:

Auth Screen:

Branch selector dropdown

Email input

Password input

Sign In button

Create Account button

Forgot Password link

Dashboard Screen:

Header: AutoFlow logo, Switch Branch menu, greeting (e.g., “Hello, Sarah”)

Status cards at the top (Checked In, In Diagnostics, Waiting for Parts, Ready for Pickup, Express Lane)

Current Queue table with columns: Queue #, Reg Number, Customer Name, Service Type, Status (dropdown), Actions (icons for chat, key, checkmark)

Quick Info panel (Cars in Queue, Avg Wait Time)

Priority Lane panel (VIP Fleet, Oil Change count)

Add New Job button

Update Queue Display button

View Admin Dashboard button

UI Details:

Use the colors, spacing, fonts, and icons from the screenshots you provided

Status dropdown colors:

Checked In → Blue

In Diagnostics → Orange

Waiting for Parts → Red

Work in Progress → Green

Ready for Pickup → Green

Buttons styled like screenshots (primary blue for Sign In / Update, green for Create Account / checkmarks)

Include hover & focus states

Behavior:

Auth form validates email & password inputs

Branch selector filters dashboard content (fake data for now)

Status dropdown in table updates row color according to selection (reactively)

Queue table is scrollable on smaller screens

Fully responsive layout (dashboard cards stack on mobile, table scrolls horizontally if needed)

Optional Extras for Realism:

Use dummy data for queue & customer details

Include icons for chat, key, and checkmark (e.g., Heroicons / FontAwesome)

Add minor animations (hover effects, status color changes)

Deliverables:

React project with all components and Tailwind styling

Fully responsive, no backend needed yet (use dummy JSON or state)
