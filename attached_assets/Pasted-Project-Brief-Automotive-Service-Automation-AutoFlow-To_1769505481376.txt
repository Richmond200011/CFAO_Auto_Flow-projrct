Project Brief: Automotive Service Automation ("AutoFlow") To: ZuZo Development Team (New Hires) From: Gilbert Debrah, Samuel Odame. Project Duration: 1 Week (Sprint 1) Tech Stack: QContact, WhatsApp API, Node.js/Python (for webhooks), Automation Logic 1. The Business Problem Large car dealerships in Accra (like Toyota Ghana, Japan Motors, and Rana Motors) face a major customer service bottleneck: ● The "Status Anxiety" Loop: Customers call the service center repeatedly to ask, "Is my car ready?" ● Wasted Labor: Service Advisors spend 40% of their day answering these phone calls instead of managing technicians. ● Lost Revenue: If a car is ready at 2 PM but the customer isn't called until 5 PM, the car takes up valuable space overnight. 2. The Solution: "AutoFlow" We are building an automated notification system similar to the "Pharmacy/Dental Model" we successfully deployed for Platinum Dental. The Workflow: 1. Drop-off: Customer drops off the car. A "Job Card" is created. 2. Processing: The mechanic works on the car. 3. Trigger: The mechanic updates the status to "Ready." 4. Action: The system automatically sends a WhatsApp message to the customer with the invoice and pickup time. 3. Functional Requirements (The "MVP") Your team must build a working prototype with the following three components: A. The Intake Bot (QContact Flow) ● Channel: WhatsApp. ● Function: A bot that allows a customer to book a service slot or check their vehicle status without talking to a human. ● Logic: ○ User says: "Book Service" $\rightarrow$ Bot asks: "Vehicle Reg Number?" & "Preferred Date?" ○ User says: "Check Status" $\rightarrow$ Bot checks database $\rightarrow$ Returns: "Your vehicle is currently in the Washing Bay." B. The Service Dashboard (Internal Tool) ● User: The Service Advisor / Mechanic. ● Interface: A simple web interface (or a QContact Custom Field setup) with a "Status Dropdown." ● Statuses: Checked In $\rightarrow$ In Diagnostics $\rightarrow$ Waiting for Parts $\rightarrow$ Work in Progress $\rightarrow$ Ready for Pickup. C. The Automation Engine (The "Brain") ● Requirement: Use Webhooks/API. ● Logic: ○ IF Status changes to Waiting for Parts, THEN send WhatsApp: "Hello [Name], we need to order a part. Estimated delay: 24 hours. Reply YES to proceed." ○ IF Status changes to Ready for Pickup, THEN send WhatsApp: "Good news! Your car [Reg Number] is ready. Your bill is [Amount]. Click here to pay." 4. Developer Tasks & Assignments Developer A (Backend & API): ● Set up the database to store "Vehicle Reg", "Customer Phone", and "Current Status". ● Create the Webhook that listens for status changes in the Dashboard. Developer B (QContact Flow Designer): ● Map out the conversation flow in QContact. ● Ensure the bot handles errors gracefully (e.g., if the user types a wrong Reg Number). Developer C (Frontend/Dashboard): ● Create the simple UI for the mechanics. It must be mobile-friendly (mechanics use tablets). 5. Success Metrics (Definition of Done) 1. Zero-Touch Status Check: I must be able to text the bot "Status" and get a real-time answer without human intervention. 2. Instant Notification: When the status changes to "Ready," I must receive the WhatsApp message within 30 seconds. 3. Documentation: A 1-page PDF manual on "How to use AutoFlow" for the Service Advisors. 6. Why We Are Doing This This is not just a coding exercise. Once this is built, ZuZo will pitch this solution to Japan Motors and Toyota Ghana. You are creating a product that we will sell immediately. Deadline for Demo: [Insert Date] >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 1. Updated Project Brief for Dev Team The scope has expanded. They are no longer building just a notification trigger; they are building a Queue Logic Engine. Project Name: CFAO AutoFlow + Queue Manager New Feature Requirement: Multi-Tenancy (Per-Branch Logic) Added Developer Tasks: ● Backend (Multi-Branch Architecture): ○ Database must segregate data by Center_ID (e.g., CFAO_Airport, CFAO_Tema, CFAO_Kumasi). ○ Admin View: A "Super-Admin" dashboard that shows the queue length of all centers on one screen. ● The "Queue Logic" Algorithm: ○ Create a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) logic, but with an "Express Lane" override (for simple oil changes or VIP Loxea fleet). ● The "Digital Signage" View (Frontend): ○ Build a TV-friendly URL (e.g., zuzo.co/display/airport) that displays the current queue status for the waiting room (Just like a bank or airport flight board). ● WhatsApp Logic Update: ○ Add "Queue Position" updates: "There are 3 cars ahead of you. Est wait: 45 mins."
